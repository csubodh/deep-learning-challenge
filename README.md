# deep-learning-challenge

a. Purpose: Nearal Network was used to identify relationship between input and output data where data is non linear. The data was converted to linear format to use for the model

b. Results
    Data Processing
    - Application type as 'T3' used as features
    - Variables to be dropped - T4,T6,T5,T19,T8,T7,T10,Other      


    Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    - 2 hidden layers were used
    - First layer had 8 features while second had 5 features
    - Had to change features couple times before desired results was achived


c. Summary - Overall the model improved as features were increased. The accuracy increased from 61% to 95%
